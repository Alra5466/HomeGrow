    <h2>Addressing the Need</h2>
    <p>Our initiative tackles the critical issue of nutritional gaps among college students, a demographic facing widespread micronutrient deficiencies that affect both their physical health and cognitive functions. These challenges stem from limited access to nutritious foods, compounded by the demands of their busy schedules and limited budgets.</p>
    <p><strong>Target User Group:</strong> We specifically focus on college students living in urban settings, who lack outdoor spaces for gardening and are in dire need of convenient, cost-effective, and nutritious food solutions. This group's lifestyle needs highlight the importance of ease of use, affordability, and time-saving in product design.</p>
    <p><strong>User Insights:</strong> Understanding our users' perspective is crucial. College students' main pain points include the hassle of traditional cooking and the high cost of healthy eating options. Our solution leverages these insights, ensuring it meets their specific requirements for convenience, simplicity, and efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Engagement and Refinement:</strong> We are committed to engaging with our target audience through surveys, prototype testing, and feedback sessions throughout the development process. This user-centered approach ensures our product design and development are guided by real-world use cases, enhancing usability and satisfaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Addressing this need is not just about filling a market gap; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of countless students. With about 59% of American college students suffering from nutrient deficiencies (The College Puzzle, Stanford University), our project's significance is underscored by the urgent need to provide an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods, thereby helping students lead healthier lives.</p>
    <p><strong>Need Statement:</strong> Busy college students require access to an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods to overcome the challenge of micronutrient deficiencies and lead healthier lives.</p>
