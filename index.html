    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our initiative is centered on revolutionizing the way microgreens are cultivated by introducing a system that is not only automated but also compact, clean, and exceedingly user-friendly. Microgreens, known for their rapid growth cycle of just 5-7 days, are a powerhouse of essential micronutrients. Our mission is to democratize the process of growing these nutrient-dense greens, making it an effortless, affordable reality for everyone, especially college students who often grapple with nutritional deficiencies. By integrating our solution into their daily lives, we aim to bridge the nutritional gap prevalent among young adults pursuing higher education.</p>
