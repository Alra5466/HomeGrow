    <h1>Growing Food at Home - Microgreens</h1>
    <p>MECN 5055 Advanced Product Design</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our initiative is centered on revolutionizing the way microgreens are cultivated by introducing a system that is not only automated but also compact, clean, and exceedingly user-friendly. Microgreens, known for their rapid growth cycle of just 5-7 days, are a powerhouse of essential micronutrients. Our mission is to democratize the process of growing these nutrient-dense greens, making it an effortless, affordable reality for everyone, especially college students who often grapple with nutritional deficiencies. By integrating our solution into their daily lives, we aim to bridge the nutritional gap prevalent among young adults pursuing higher education.</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h2>Addressing the Need</h2>
    <p>Our initiative tackles the critical issue of nutritional gaps among college students, a demographic facing widespread micronutrient deficiencies that affect both their physical health and cognitive functions. These challenges stem from limited access to nutritious foods, compounded by the demands of their busy schedules and limited budgets.</p>
    <p><strong>Target User Group:</strong> We specifically focus on college students living in urban settings, who lack outdoor spaces for gardening and are in dire need of convenient, cost-effective, and nutritious food solutions. This group's lifestyle needs highlight the importance of ease of use, affordability, and time-saving in product design.</p>
    <p><strong>User Insights:</strong> Understanding our users' perspective is crucial. College students' main pain points include the hassle of traditional cooking and the high cost of healthy eating options. Our solution leverages these insights, ensuring it meets their specific requirements for convenience, simplicity, and efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Engagement and Refinement:</strong> We are committed to engaging with our target audience through surveys, prototype testing, and feedback sessions throughout the development process. This user-centered approach ensures our product design and development are guided by real-world use cases, enhancing usability and satisfaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Addressing this need is not just about filling a market gap; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of countless students. With about 59% of American college students suffering from nutrient deficiencies (The College Puzzle, Stanford University), our project's significance is underscored by the urgent need to provide an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods, thereby helping students lead healthier lives.</p>
    <p><strong>Need Statement:</strong> Busy college students require access to an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods to overcome the challenge of micronutrient deficiencies and lead healthier lives.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
    <p>Our product aims to address the urgent need for accessible, nutritious food options among college students, drawing directly from their perspective. To ensure our solution meets this need, we have established the following critical and secondary design criteria.</p>
    
    <h3>Critical Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>These criteria are essential for our medium-fidelity prototype to effectively satisfy the identified need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compactness:</strong> Must fit within small, confined spaces typical of urban living and dormitories, making it suitable for our target user group's living conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> The system should maintain a hygienic environment from seeding to harvesting to ensure user safety and product integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Operation & Maintenance:</strong> Designed for ease, akin to operating a basic kitchen appliance, requiring minimal effort from users unfamiliar with gardening.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Cost:</strong> Affordability is key, making the system accessible to students and individuals on tight budgets.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> It must facilitate the growth of nutrient-rich microgreens, directly addressing the core need for better nutrition among college students.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Efficient use of water and electricity, minimizing the environmental footprint and operational costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Promotes sustainable food consumption practices, aligning with broader environmental goals.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Secondary Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>After meeting the critical criteria, the following secondary objectives will enhance the product's value:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Besides functionality, the design should add an element of greenery and style to living spaces, appealing to the aesthetic sensibilities of the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability to expand or adapt the system for a wider variety of plants, offering users more options once the primary goal of growing microgreens is achieved.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Integration with smart devices for monitoring and managing the growth process, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>User Education:</strong> Incorporating educational tools or resources to inform users about the nutritional benefits of microgreens and how to incorporate them into their diet effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These criteria will guide the development of our product through to the end of the semester, with the flexibility to refine our approach based on further need-finding and user feedback until Week 9. The secondary criteria will shape the evolution of our product into a high-fidelity prototype, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in addressing the nutritional needs of college students.</p>

    <h2>Pretotyping: Exploring Concepts with Speed and Efficiency</h2>

        <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <p>We aimed to answer key questions about our design assumptions, including Microgreen taste preference across different demographics, and the preferred form factors for an indoor gardening system. Our goal was to discern whether a decorative appeal, space efficiency, or yield maximization would drive user preference and satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Pretotype Planning</h2>
    <p>Our pretotype strategy was meticulously crafted to dissect specific user inclinations, such as the desirability of yield over aesthetics or compactness. Each pretotype, from a decorative model to one with a built-in juicer, was designed to unveil insights into user priorities and practical needs in indoor gardening solutions.</p>

    <h2>Pretotype Construction</h2>
    <p>Five distinct pretotypes emerged from our design process: a stacked model maximizing yield, a visually appealing decorative piece, compact small and large trays for varied space accommodations, and an innovative model combining gardening with juicing functionality. Crafted from paper and cardboard, these models served as tangible representations of potential product directions, offering a visual and tactile feedback mechanism for early-stage user interaction studies.</p>

    <h2>Pretotype Testing</h2>
    <p>Our selection of six college students—split evenly by gender—was intentional, seeking to mirror our target market's diversity and gather nuanced feedback. The testing phase was revealing; female participants showed a clear enthusiasm for the concept, contrasting with the male participants' relative disinterest and taste aversions. This feedback was instrumental in refining our understanding of market needs and preferences.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways from Pretotyping</h2>
    <p>The testing underscored a definitive preference for the stacked design, pointing towards an innovative solution that married space efficiency with yield maximization. Notably, the feedback illuminated the potential of targeting female demographics more closely, while also considering the integration of functional enhancements, such as wall-mounting capabilities, to broaden the product's appeal.</p>

    <h2>Concept to Carry Forward</h2>
    <p>Armed with these insights, our path forward is clear: we will advance the stacked garden concept, emphasizing modularity, space efficiency, and aesthetic versatility. The next phase involves 3D printing to bring these concepts into the physical realm, supplemented by technological integrations for water and light management, aimed at simplifying the user experience and enhancing plant growth.</p>
