    <h1>Growing Food at Home - Microgreens</h1>
    <p>MECN 5055 Advanced Product Design</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Focused on growing microgreens in a convenient, automated, clean, and compact manner. Microgreens are fast growing (5-7 days) and packed with micronutrients. Providing simple and cheap access to growing and consuming these nutritious foods will help address the large nutrient deficiency that college students have.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Users & Value</h2>
    <p>Target Audience: Urban residents and college students who lack access to outdoor growing areas. The group we have chosen that fits this description best is busy college students.</p>
    <p>Need Statement: Busy college students need access to cheap and simple foods that are nutrient dense so that they can address the issue of micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
    <p>“Studies show that about 59% of American college students are nutrient deficient.” - The College Puzzle, Stanford University</p>
    <p>Consistently eating healthy foods is time consuming, expensive, and overwhelming for busy college students who are learning to provide food for themselves. This leads many students to end up with nutrient deficiencies that are negatively affecting their health, productivity, and happiness.</p>
    <p>What is important to College Students? Convenience, Low Cost, Easy to Operate and Maintain, Not Time Consuming.</p>
