        <h2>Shift in Need and User Focus</h2>
        <p>Originally centered on addressing micronutrient deficiencies through promoting the growth of nutrient-dense foods, our initiative has evolved to specifically target health-conscious individuals in developed countries. This pivot reflects a broader understanding of micronutrient deficiencies beyond college students, recognizing that these deficiencies impact a wider demographic. The shift from promoting home-grown microgreens to addressing the supplement market underscores our response to these changing needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Adapting the Design Process</h2>
        <p>This new focus has guided our design process towards creating solutions that cater to individuals seeking convenient, cost-effective ways to supplement their diets. Recognizing the complexity of dietary habits and the prevalent reliance on processed foods, our solution now emphasizes ease of integration into daily routines, affordability, and leveraging whole-food forms over synthetic supplements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Uncertainties and User Preferences</h2>
        <p>Despite refining our target audience and approach, uncertainties remain regarding the specific preferences and barriers faced by health-conscious individuals. Questions about the optimal balance between supplement form, cost, convenience, and the desire for whole-food-based solutions highlight areas that require further exploration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Design Risks from Uncertainties</h2>
        <p>The uncertainties pose risks of developing solutions that may not fully align with user expectations or lifestyles. There's a particular concern that our interventions might not adequately bridge the gap between the convenience of processed foods and the benefits of a nutrient-rich diet, potentially affecting user adoption and overall impact.</p>
    <p>Another risk involves the pricing and perceived value of our solutions. High costs, as seen with products like Athletic Greens AG1, could deter our target demographic, necessitating a careful balance between quality, effectiveness, and affordability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Strategies for Clarifying User Needs</h2>
        <p>To address these uncertainties and refine our approach, we plan to engage directly with our target audience through comprehensive surveys, interviews, and prototype testing. This engagement will focus on understanding their dietary habits, supplementation practices, and barriers to adopting healthier eating habits. Additionally, exploring preferences for supplement forms—whether pills, powders, or whole-food-based solutions—will inform the development of more user-friendly and appealing products. Insights from these interactions will be pivotal in iterating our design to better meet the needs and expectations of health-conscious individuals.</p>
