    <h2>Addressing the Need Updated</h2>
    <p>Our initiative tackles the critical issue of micronutrient deficiencies that accompany the modern diet. Micronutrients are the vitamins and minerals that many of us are familiar with from being on the back of our food labels, but not many people know how they actually impact our lives. The range of impacts from the entirety of the micronutrient spectrum is too vast to succinctly convey, but we can look at the impacts of one of the most commonly deficient micronutrients, Vitamin A. From Healthline, the symptoms of a vitamin A deficiency include dry eyes, dry skin, night blindness, infertility, delayed growth, throat and chest infections, poor wound healing, and acne/breakouts. These symptoms demonstrate the range of impacts even one micronutrient deficiency can have on a person. The bigger problem is that most people are deficient in multiple micronutrients. According to a research article published by Oregon State University, “94.3% of the US population do not meet the daily requirement for vitamin D, 88.5% for vitamin E, 52.2% for magnesium, 44.1% for calcium, 43.0% for vitamin A, and 38.9% for vitamin C.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>To understand this problem further, we must analyze why these micronutrient deficiencies are occurring. This is a complex issue with many causes, but two simple explanations are the underconsumption of fruits and vegetables, and the overconsumption of processed foods. Again, the research article from Oregon State states, “Many Americans are not reaching micronutrient intake requirements from food alone (24, 25), presumably due to eating an energy-rich, nutrient-poor diet. About 75% of the US population (ages ≥1 year) do not consume the recommended intake of fruit, and more than 80% do not consume the recommended intake of vegetables.” Fruits and vegetables are often energy-poor foods, as they do not contain many calories, proteins, carbs, or fats (macronutrients), but they do contain many of these crucial micronutrients. The added cooking complexity, high cost, and relatively poor taste of these food staples often leads to many Americans opting to eat energy-dense, cheaper, and better-tasting highly processed food options. In a research study conducted on the Brazilian population in 2009, the researchers found that, “the micronutrient content in ultra-processed foods tends to be lower than this content that exists in other foods. The inferiority of ultra-processed foods is even more evident when they are compared with natural or minimally processed foods. For 16 of the 17 micronutrients under study, the mean content found in the set of ultra-processed foods consumed by Brazilians was lower than the mean content found in the natural or minimally processed foods.” Processed foods also provide too much micronutrients in some categories, as shown by the fact that “more than 97% of the population had excessive intakes of sodium.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>These research studies align with our intuitive understanding in general, we should probably eat more fruits and vegetables, and less processed foods, like our parents told us. Until many people learn to adopt this healthy eating, we can look at it more from a solutions perspective and ask, “How can we make it easier to consume more micronutrients?” The primary solution that exists on the market is multivitamins and other supplements. Multivitamins can provide a good option to cheaply and conveniently supplement your diet with a range of micronutrients, in an attempt to fill any dietary holes you may have. Many consumers on the market benefit from multivitamins, but many also dislike that it is supplementing a result of over-processed foods with a highly processed solution. Another issue with multivitamins is that they often end up becoming a chore because it is a dry and tasteless pill that you have to swallow daily. Some consumers, also don’t want to consume multivitamins because they struggle with consuming pills. Similarly, there are now products like Athletic Greens AG1 popping up on the market, which attempt to replicate the benefits of multivitamins, but with a more whole-food form. AG1 provides a powdered greens mix, which is the result of multiple powdered plants to once again provide a solution to the micronutrient deficiencies. This product is consumed as a drink that is mixed with water, which often provides a more fun experience for the user which makes them feel healthy while also being convenient. The largest downside of AG1 is the cost, which comes out to $79 per month.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Target User Group</h2>
    <p>We specifically focus on health-conscious individuals in developed countries. They care enough about their diet to understand the crucial role micronutrients play in their health but struggle to find the balance between cost, convenience, and organic food options to completely address their micronutrient needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>User Insights</h2>
    <p>Eating a varied enough diet to reach all of the necessary micronutrient goals is time-consuming, costly, and overwhelming. The provided solutions on the market are either bland and dreadful to integrate into their routine or too costly.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Engagement and Refinement</h2>
    <p>We are committed to engaging with our target audience through surveys, prototype testing, and feedback sessions throughout the development process. This user-centered approach ensures our product design and development are guided by real-world use cases, enhancing usability and satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>Addressing this need is not just about filling a market gap; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of countless people. With a large majority of Americans having a deficiency in multiple micronutrients, our project's significance is underscored by the urgent need to provide an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods, thereby helping people lead healthier lives.</p>

    <h2>Need Statement</h2>
    <p>Health-conscious individuals require access to an affordable, easy-to-use system for growing nutrient-dense foods to overcome the challenge of micronutrient deficiencies and lead healthier lives.</p>

    <h2>How the New Needfinding Changes Our Design</h2>
    <p>This new need-finding perspective focuses on our product moreso addressing the supplement market as opposed to the growing food-at-home market. This changes our goal to construct a home growing system for the purpose of providing a regenerative, engaging, and low-cost supplement instead of providing a way for people to grow microgreens at home. Our team was mostly internally aligned with this goal from the start, but we did not do an adequate job of portraying our project in this light. It doesn’t change the design process for our actual product but impacts the way in which we would like to present our need-finding and product value in the future. The other change we made, was moving our target market from college students to health-conscious individuals. This is because we realized that while would be providing value to college students by improving their health, many of them simply don’t care. Health-conscious individuals is a term that probably needs a little more refinement, because we are focused on health-conscious individuals with a medium budget range and a desire for organically sourced foods, but is a good target market for the time being. Again, these changes don’t drastically impact our overall product, but are moreso adjusting the target market and marketing to better fit the value of the product we have created.</p>
