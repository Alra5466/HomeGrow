    <h2>3D Printed Grow Tray Development</h2>
    <p>We have fabricated a critical component of our final design, the grow tray, in a medium-fidelity prototype. This prototype is functional and includes a 5in x 7in grow tray, which features a 3D printed rigid outer rectangle with a stainless steel mesh insert. We are currently iterating on the handle design to enhance its ergonomics, making it easier to hold and remove from the main grow tray based on user feedback.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping Questions</h2>
    <p>As we refine our microgreens growing system, we focus on critical areas that impact user experience and system efficiency. These guiding questions will direct our prototyping efforts to ensure our solution meets the needs and preferences of our target users.</p>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Counter Space Utilization</h3>
        <p>How can we design the prototype to optimize for limited counter space while ensuring it remains functional and accessible for users?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Human Factors/Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>In what ways can we improve the ergonomics of interacting with the device, particularly in harvesting microgreens and performing maintenance tasks like cleaning?</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>General Usage and Appeal</h3>
        <p>Through prototyping, how can we assess the aesthetic appeal of the device and its impact on a user's likelihood to incorporate it into their daily routine?</p>

    <h2>Prototyping: Form Factor and User Interaction Exploration</h2>
    <p>We have created a prototype from wood to address questions around form factor and counter space. This prototype includes individual growing containers to test user interaction with removing the containers. Our goal was to evaluate the prototype's fit in a typical kitchen environment and its usability in terms of interacting with the growing containers.</p>
    <p>Key takeaways from this phase include concerns that the prototype may be too large for typical counter spaces, and the individual containers may also be too big, making them challenging to remove. We are considering adding handles to the containers to facilitate easier removal.</p>

    <h3>Prototype Descriptions</h3>
    <p>Our prototyping efforts are focused on building and testing at least four different concepts or refinements around our chosen concept. Each prototype is constructed with specific goals in mind, tested with our target market, and evaluated for insights that can guide our design process.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototype 1:</strong> Constructed from wood, designed to test the form factor and counter space utilization. The goal was to assess the prototype's size and the usability of individual growing containers.

        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototype 2:</strong> This prototype explores various grow substrates to identify the most effective medium for plant growth. It aims to compare traditional soil against hydroponic mediums and other alternatives in terms of growth speed, health, and nutrient density of the plants.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototype 3:</strong> Focused on testing different lighting solutions to optimize plant growth. The prototype incorporates various light sources, including LED, fluorescent, and natural light, to determine the most energy-efficient and productive lighting condition for different plant types.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototype 4:</strong> Designed to test the harvesting method, this prototype includes a modular design that allows for easy access to the plants. The goal is to evaluate the efficiency and convenience of different harvesting techniques, ensuring minimal damage to the plants and ease of use for the consumer.

    <h3>Testing and Insights</h3>
    <p>We will begin testing our prototypes in the coming weeks with our target users and report back with collected data here.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways from Prototyping</h3>
    <p>The primary takeaways from our prototyping efforts highlight the importance of counter space efficiency, optimal grow conditions, energy-efficient lighting, and user-friendly harvesting methods. Going forward, we will explore reducing the overall size of the prototype, experimenting with grow substrates and lighting conditions, and adding features to the containers to enhance usability. These changes aim to address the feedback received and make our product more appealing and practical for our target users.</p>
