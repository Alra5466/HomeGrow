    <h2>Water Tray Development and Analysis</h2>
    <p>We have recently completed the development of a new water tray, a key component of our microgreens growing system. This tray, measuring 15.5x9.75x7.5 inches, is crafted from wood and sealed with silicone to ensure it is water-resistant. It is specifically designed to support seed trays in a submerged environment to promote optimal growth conditions for microgreens.</p>

    <h3>Calculating Required Water Volume</h3>
    <p>To determine the amount of water needed to adequately cover the seed trays to a depth of 0.5 inches, we perform the following calculation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Volume formula: <em>Volume = Length × Width × Depth</em></li>
        <li>Given dimensions: <em>Length = 15.5 inches, Width = 7.5 inches, Depth = 0.5 inches</em></li>
        <li>Calculated volume in cubic inches: <em>15.5 × 7.5 × 0.5 = 58.125 cubic inches</em></li>
        <li>Conversion to liters (1 cubic inch = 0.0163871 liters): <em>58.125 cubic inches × 0.0163871 = 0.95 liters</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculated volume of water required to reach a depth of 0.5 inches is approximately <strong>0.95 liters</strong>. This ensures that the seed trays are sufficiently submerged to promote growth while optimizing water usage.</p>
    
    <h3>Significance of the Water Depth</h3>
    <p>The depth of 0.5 inches is critical as it ensures the seed trays are just submerged enough to allow for optimal moisture absorption without oversaturation, which is essential for effective germination and growth of microgreens. This depth also makes it easy to maintain and manage the water levels, helping prevent issues such as mold or root rot that can occur with excessive water.</p>
    
    <p>User feedback has emphasized the need for easier handling and removal of the tray, guiding our next design iteration to improve the ergonomics of the tray.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping Questions</h2>
    <p>As we refine our microgreens growing system, we focus on critical areas that impact user experience and system efficiency. These guiding questions will direct our prototyping efforts to ensure our solution meets the needs and preferences of our target users.</p>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Counter Space Utilization</h3>
        <p>How can we design the prototype to optimize for limited counter space while ensuring it remains functional and accessible for users?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Human Factors/Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>In what ways can we improve the ergonomics of interacting with the device, particularly in harvesting microgreens and performing maintenance tasks like cleaning?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Lighting/Watering Growing System</h3>
        <p>What are the most effective and user-friendly designs for the lighting and watering systems that we can prototype to ensure optimal growth of microgreens?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>General Usage and Appeal</h3>
        <p>Through prototyping, how can we assess the aesthetic appeal of the device and its impact on a user's likelihood to incorporate it into their daily routine?</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Prototyping: Form Factor and User Interaction Exploration</h2>
    <p>We have created a prototype from wood to address questions around form factor and counter space. This prototype includes individual growing containers to test user interaction with removing the containers. Our goal was to evaluate the prototype's fit in a typical kitchen environment and its usability in terms of interacting with the growing containers.</p>
    <p>Key takeaways from this phase include concerns that the prototype may be too large for typical counter spaces, and the individual containers may also be too big, making them challenging to remove. We are considering adding handles to the containers to facilitate easier removal.</p>

    <h3>Prototype Descriptions</h3>
    <p>Our prototyping efforts are focused on building and testing at least four different concepts or refinements around our chosen concept. Each prototype is constructed with specific goals in mind, tested with our target market, and evaluated for insights that can guide our design process.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototype 1:</strong> Constructed from wood, designed to test the form factor and counter space utilization. The goal was to assess the prototype's size and the usability of individual growing containers.

    <h3>Key Takeaways from Prototyping</h3>
    <p>The primary takeaways from our prototyping efforts highlight the importance of counter space efficiency, optimal grow conditions, energy-efficient lighting, and user-friendly harvesting methods. Going forward, we will explore reducing the overall size of the prototype, experimenting with grow substrates and lighting conditions, and adding features to the containers to enhance usability. These changes aim to address the feedback received and make our product more appealing and practical for our target users.</p>
