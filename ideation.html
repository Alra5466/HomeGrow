    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>Using personas in the ideation process is essential for developing products that meet the specific needs and challenges of our target users. By focusing on the unique backgrounds, goals, and obstacles of each persona, we can brainstorm solutions that are not only innovative but also deeply resonant with our audience. This user-centered approach ensures our product design and development are guided by real-world use cases, enhancing usability and satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Below is a concept map that visualizes the connections between our personas' needs, the product features designed to meet those needs, and the broader impact on their lifestyle. This map serves as a foundation for our ideation process, helping us to explore and refine our ideas comprehensively.</p>

    <h2>Meet Our Personas</h2>
    <p>Personas are fictional characters created based on our research to represent the different user types that might use our product. They help us understand our users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Creating personas allows our team to design a more user-centered product by keeping us focused on user-specific needs and challenges. Through these personas, we aim to address the diverse requirements of our potential users, ensuring our solution is inclusive and beneficial for a wide range of individuals.</p>
