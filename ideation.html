    <h2>Latest Updates on Ideation</h2>
    <p>As our project progresses, our ideation phase continues to evolve, building upon our initial concepts to enhance functionality and user experience. We are focused on refining our initial ideas to better meet user needs by making them more adaptable, efficient, and aligned with our users' lifestyles.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Refining Our Initial Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Enhancing the scalability of our microgreen kits to accommodate various living spaces, allowing for customization based on user preference and spatial constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Technology Integration:</strong> Incorporating smart sensors and a companion app that provides users with real-time data on plant health, moisture levels, and nutrient needs, simplifying the care process and enhancing user interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Features:</strong> Adding an educational component that offers tips and tutorials on microgreen cultivation, making the kits not only a source of nutrition but also a learning tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Services:</strong> Developing a subscription model for seed and nutrient refills, ensuring users have continuous access to resources needed for sustainable gardening practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These enhancements are designed to amplify the user-friendliness and environmental benefits of our products, making them a more integral part of daily living and wellness routines.</p>

    <h2>Concept Evolution Map</h2>
    <p>To visually track the evolution of these ideas, we've created an updated concept map that details how each modification and addition enhances the original designs. This map serves as a dynamic blueprint of our thinking process, illustrating the progressive refinement of our concepts.</p>
    <!-- Replace 'your_concept_map_URL' with the actual URL of your concept map -->
