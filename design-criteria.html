    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
    <p>Our product aims to address the urgent need for accessible, nutritious food options among college students, drawing directly from their perspective. To ensure our solution meets this need, we have established the following critical and secondary design criteria.</p>
    
    <h3>Critical Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>These criteria are essential for our medium-fidelity prototype to effectively satisfy the identified need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compactness:</strong> Must fit within small, confined spaces typical of urban living and dormitories, making it suitable for our target user group's living conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> The system should maintain a hygienic environment from seeding to harvesting to ensure user safety and product integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Operation & Maintenance:</strong> Designed for ease, akin to operating a basic kitchen appliance, requiring minimal effort from users unfamiliar with gardening.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Cost:</strong> Affordability is key, making the system accessible to students and individuals on tight budgets.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> It must facilitate the growth of nutrient-rich microgreens, directly addressing the core need for better nutrition among college students.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Efficient use of water and electricity, minimizing the environmental footprint and operational costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Promotes sustainable food consumption practices, aligning with broader environmental goals.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Secondary Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>After meeting the critical criteria, the following secondary objectives will enhance the product's value:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Besides functionality, the design should add an element of greenery and style to living spaces, appealing to the aesthetic sensibilities of the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability to expand or adapt the system for a wider variety of plants, offering users more options once the primary goal of growing microgreens is achieved.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Integration with smart devices for monitoring and managing the growth process, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>User Education:</strong> Incorporating educational tools or resources to inform users about the nutritional benefits of microgreens and how to incorporate them into their diet effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These criteria will guide the development of our product through to the end of the semester, with the flexibility to refine our approach based on further need-finding and user feedback until Week 9. The secondary criteria will shape the evolution of our product into a high-fidelity prototype, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in addressing the nutritional needs of college students.</p>
